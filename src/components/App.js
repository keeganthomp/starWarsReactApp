  // PROPS AND STATE
  // Set props and state below.
  // You should set state for vehicles (empty array), value (empty string), pilot (empty) string.
  // Enter your code below:

  // FORM: HANDLE INPUT CHANGES
  // handleNameChange below:
  // See form lesson for details.
  // Enter your code below:
  handleNameChange = event => {
    let value = event.target.value;
    this.setState({ value });
  };

  //  FORM: SUBMIT METHOD
  // handleSubmit below:
  // See form lesson for details.
  // Once the form is sumbited, two things need to happen: set the state of pilot to the input value.
  // Then, set the value of the input back to an empty string.
  // Enter your code below:
  handleSubmit = event => {
    event.preventDefault();
    let pilot = this.state.value;
    this.setState({ pilot});
  };

  // LIFECYCLE
  // Which lifecycle is best for fetching data?
  // Inside this lifecycle, you will fetch the vehicles from here: https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/
  // Once you have fetched that data, set the state of vehicles to the fetched data.
  // In your response look for 'results'. It should return this array.
  // You will want to use this array when you set the state of 'vehicles'. You will need this data in your render.
  // Enter your code below:
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/")
      .then(response => {
        console.log("response:", response);
        return response.json();
      })
      .then(data => {
        console.log("PROOPPPPPPPSSS", data);
        let vehicle = data.results;
        this.setState({ vehicle });
      });
  }

  // RENDER
  // Before you can map over the data you've fetched, you will first need to store that 'state' in a variable.
  // Map over the data.
  // Don't forget to set the 'key'. In this case, use the vehicle name.
  // You will need the following values: name, model, manufacturer, class, passengers, crew, length, max speed, and cargo capacity.
  // Rendering: create a 'card' for each of the vehicles. consult the Bootstrap 4 docs for details.
  // Enter your code below:

  render() {
    /*
    
    Store vehicles state in a variable.
    Map over this variable to access the values needed to render.
    */
